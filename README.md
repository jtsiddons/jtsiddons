# Hello! I'm @jtsiddons

I am postdoctoral researcher in Mathematics and Statistics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, NS. I'm primarily based in the Oceanography department as part of [mmab](https://mmab.ca/).

## Interests

- I am interested in analysing plankton data using Julia.
- I use graphical analysis tools to visualise associations/interactions between pairs of plankton species.
- I use Lasso.jl to detect pairwise relationships & effects of external forcing (such as temperature) on those relationships.
