## Interests

- I am interested in analysing plankton data using Julia.
- I use graphical analysis tools to visualise associations/interactions between pairs of plankton species.
- I use Lasso.jl to detect pairwise relationships & effects of external forcing (such as temperature) on those relationships.
- Data visualisation. I enjoy experimenting with different visualisation packages/tools.
