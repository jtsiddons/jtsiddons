# Hello! I'm [@jtsiddons](https://www.github.com/jtsiddons) :fish:

I am a research data scientist. I work primarily in the field of graphical data science, working on the inference of relationships between elements within the data.

---

## Interests

- I am interested in analysing plankton data using Julia.
- I use graphical analysis tools to visualise associations/interactions between pairs of plankton species.
- I use Lasso.jl to detect pairwise relationships & effects of external forcing (such as temperature) on those relationships.
- Data visualisation. I enjoy experimenting with different visualisation packages/tools.

## Languages

- Julia
- R
- Python
- shell scripting
